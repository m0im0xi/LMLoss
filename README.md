# Project Summary
This is an unofficial implementation of the [Large Margin Discriminative Loss for Classification](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.18499v2#S1) paper.\
This repository implements a novel discriminative loss function for deep learning, as presented in the referenced paper. The loss function enhances neural network performance by:





* Promoting intra-class compactness: Minimizing the distance between samples of the same class.



* Enhancing inter-class separability: Using a margin loss to ensure a minimum distance to the closest class boundary.
